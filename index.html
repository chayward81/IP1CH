      <h2>About Charlie Hayward</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in the suburbs of Portland. My past career background was in communications and sales, but about three years ago I decided to pursue an education in computer science. I attended several schools while transitioning through a life change, and finally decided to pursue a targeted education in web development. Part of this motivation was a result of me working in a QA role for a fast-growing software company, and remains a motivation during my employment at this company.</p>

      <p>Some of my hobbies include, but are not limited to:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Music (live events, playing guitar, etc)</li>
        <li>Programming</li>
        <li>Drinkin' beers</li>
        <li>Brewin' beers</li>
      </ol>
